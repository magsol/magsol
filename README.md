I am Shannon Quinn, currently:
 - an Associate Professor at University of Georgia
 - a Principal AI/MI Scientist at PredxBio
 - interested in anything i) 👨‍💻 open source, ii) 🐍 PyData, and iii) 🍩 donuts

### 🔭 What I do here...

On GitHub specifically? That's... complicated.

I've had recruiters complain to me that they don't see very many actual code contributions on my account. That's because
 - teaching all but consumed my academic career starting a few years before the pandemic, and most certainly during
 - in that time, all you'd really see from me are slide decks, assignment PDFs, and HTML updates sporting links to said slide decks and assignment PDFs
 - actual coding was still happening, but 1) in uncomfortably small quantities, and 2) usually in private repos (active experiments, corporate repos, etc)

I vividly remember attending the [Magical NumPy with JAX workshop](https://ericmjl.github.io/notes/tutorial-proposals/magical-numpy-with-jax-scipy-2021/) as part of SciPy 2021, and suddenly being struck by the thought: it was my first time _actually writing code_ in close to a year.

I resolved at that point to start prioritizing my own coding and work back to the kinds of activity levels I had in the mid-2010s and earlier.

Most of the work I do involves building frameworks composed of existing open source projects, so it is infrequent that I build something worth contributing back to the projects directly, BUT: open source is extraordinarily important to me, and so I'm making time to contribute back even if it's in the form of documentation.

### 🌱 I’m currently learning...

Rust! And brushing up on Julia after a few years away. Also dipping into DevOps work, particularly as I spin up and maintain my own Mastodon instance.

### 💬 Ask me about...

Python, data science, image processing, or [running](https://wherearethepancakes.wordpress.com/).

### ⚡ Fun fact...

I ran over 1600 miles in a year once. I hope to break that record someday!

### 📫 How to reach me...

Shoot me a message via twitter or e-mail, or even create an [issue](https://github.com/magsol/magsol/issues)!
